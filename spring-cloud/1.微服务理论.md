In short（简言之）, the microservice architectural style 【架构风格】\[1] is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services【独立应用变成一套小服务】, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight(轻量级沟通) mechanisms(每一个都运行在自己的进程内（容器）), often an HTTP resource API(用HTTP，将功能写成能接受请求). These services are built around business capabilities （独立业务能力）and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery（应该自动化独立部署）. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services（应该有一个能管理这些服务的中心）, which may be written in different programming languages (独立开发语言)and use different data storage technologies（独立的数据存储）.
